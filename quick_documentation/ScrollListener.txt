g.ScrollListener(target, type, function);

Okay this one is really epic. So basically, this function handle scroll events. 
It can detect the direction where the user is scrolling, and it can trigger when the
user has scrolled. 
This function needs 3 arguments
	- target (object)
	- type (string)
	- function (function)

DIRECTION:

I will start with the direction. As I said in the intro, it can detect where
the user is scrolling. While scrolling, the function in the third argument will be called
with a object called 'dir'. That object has 2 properties, top and bottom.
If the user is scrolling to the TOP, the TOP property will be TRUE and the BOTTOM propery will be FALSE.
And if the user is scrolling to the BOTTOM, the TOP property will be FALSE and the BOTTOM property will be TRUE.
Dir stands for direction by the way.

EXAMPLE 1:

(js)

g.ScrollListener(window, "direction", function() {
	console.log(dir); // The dir object.
	console.log(dir.top); // The top property.
	console.log(dir.bottom); The bottom property.
});

EXAMPLE 2:

(js)

g.ScrollListener(window, "direction", function() {
	if(dir.top) {
		// If the top property equals to true.
		console.log("Yay, I am going upwards!");
	}
	if(dir.bottom) {
		console.log("Oof! I am going downwards!");
	}
});

TRIGGER:

Now the trigger type. This one is easy to understand.
Basically, it will return a variable (boolean) called 'triggered' when the user has scrolled a amount of pixels.
Sounds a bit weird, but you will understand it in the examples below!.

EXAMPLE 1:

(js)

g.ScrollListener(window, "trigger=100", function() { 
	console.log(triggered);

	// If the user is scrolling less than 100 pixels, the triggered variable will be false.
	// If the user is scrolling more than 100 pixels, the triggered variable will be true.
})

EXAMPLE 2:

g.ScrollListener(window, "trigger=100", function() {
	if(triggered) {
		// The user has scrolled more than 100 pixels
	}
	if(!triggered) {
		// The user has scrolled less than 100 pixels.
	}
});

If the information isn't clear enough, feel free to contact me OR see the examples!
Replace the 100 and 'window' to whatever you want!
This function has 2 types, but I will add more! 

Yay 100 lines of a documentation file :)
