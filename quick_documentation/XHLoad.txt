This is a quick XMLHTTPRequest function. It will request a file and returns it as a object
into the callback function. This function needs 2 arguments. The first argument has to be a filepath, make sure the path is correct! 
The second argument has to be a function. This function will be called when the file has been loaded, or has been aborted or a error has been occurred.
A variable called response, is a object and will automatically be defined in the callback function. The object has 3 properties, text, code and main.
